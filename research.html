                <p>CUDA or Compute Unified Device Architecture is a parallel computing architecture developed by Nvidia. CUDA is the computing engine in Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that is accessible to software developers through variants of industry standard programming languages. Programmers use 'C for CUDA' (C with Nvidia extensions and certain restrictions), compiled through a PathScale Open64 C compiler, to code algorithms for execution on the GPU. CUDA architecture shares a range of computational interfaces with two competitors -the Khronos Group's OpenCL and Microsoft's DirectCompute.</p>

Considering the rapid advancement in Image Processing it has been very easy to manipulate any digital image using sophisticated tools like PhotoShop, CorelDraw etc. This proposed thesis shall provide some methods and algorithms that will attempt to restore authenticity and integrity in digital images.</p>

                    <p>The main research directions in camera captured document analysis is to deal with the page curl and perspective distortions. Current document analysis and optical character recognition systems do not expect these types of artifacts and show poor performance ,when applied directly to camera-captured documents. The goal of text de-skewing is to re-orient the skewed text lines and the goal of text de-warping is to flatten a camera-captured document such that it becomes readable by currently OCR systems. We will use Support Vector Machine and Neural Network for our Machine Learning Approach.</p>

Generally we take the images to capture objects (visually attractive region). In the proposed approach regards the important object detection in an image. The proposed algorithm contains multiple phases: preparing the super-pixels using ensemble decision trees to estimate the adjacency probability between the regions, and forming the saliency vector (visually attractive region) using the learned weights through hierarchal inheritance approach.</p>

In the "easiest" case when the camera is static, the background is often defined as the pixels that stay relatively constant, and the foreground is everything else moving around. Since BGS is often used as a pre-processing step, it is preferred to be as fast as possible.</p>
